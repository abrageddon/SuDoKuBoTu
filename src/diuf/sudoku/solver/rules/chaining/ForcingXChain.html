  <h2>Forcing X-Chain {4}</h2>
  <p>
   If we assume that {0}, it follows, through a Forcing X-Chain, that {1}.
   Therefore we can conclude that <r>{2}</r>.
  </p><p>
   The forcing chain consists of a chain of implications based on simple rules.
   The chain is an X-Chain, because it only involves a single value.
   The details of the Forcing Chain are given below.
